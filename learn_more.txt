"I'd like to learn more programming languages (currently I know Stata and a teeny bit of R and SQL). Potentially also survey data collection and analysis, and it's always good to go over more statistics, conceptually and pragmatically."
"I'd like to learn more about how to program, how to design and build surveys and how to use R for qualitative and quantitative research."
I'd like to learn more about using Microsoft Excel and SPSS for data analysis. I also need to learn how to use software that allows me to analyze data through hierarchical linear modeling.
